600.226.02 CS226 Data Structures
Project 3 - BST Maps
Part 1

Files:
	MapJHU.java - interface to function similarly to Map ADT
	
	BSTMap.java - implementation of the MapJHU.java ADT using binary
	search tree
	
	BSTMapTest.java - JUnit test suite modeled from project 2's LPHashMapTest.java
	
Summary:
	We found the most difficult method to write to be the map's remove function because of
	the number of edge cases; specifically, that of removing the root and taking different
	cases for each of the configuration of children on a node. We have also implemented
	remove() in the iterator. The iterator uses an ArrayList as an intermediate data type,
	derived from the inOrder() method of BSTMap, as the intermediate data structure that
	it iterates over. Our edited JUnit tests all check out.
