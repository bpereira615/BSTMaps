600.226.02 CS226 Data Structures
Project 3 - BST Maps
Part C - Fun with Maps

Files:
	MapJHU.java - interface to function similarly to Map ADT
	
	AVLMap.java - implementation of the MapJHU.java ADT using binary
	search tree, balancing according to AVL principle
	
	BSTMap.java - implementation of the MapJHU.java ADT using binary
	search tree
	
	P3C1.java - utility class that prints total number of words, most
	frequent words, all words that occur at most three times, and all
	words that occur within the top 10% of the most frequent words.
	
	P3C2.java - utility class that takes in list of words from console
	and analyzes their insertion into a HashMap, BSTMap and TreeMap at
	the 100, 1000, and 100000 word levels.
	
	DocToWord.java - generates list of words separated by white space
	from a document
	
	100.txt - 100 randomly generated words with line breaks
	
	1000.txt - 1000 randomly generated words with line breaks
	
	100000.txt - 100000 randomly generated words with line breaks
	
Summary:
	All work without error. Use 'java P3C1 < 100000.txt' in the command line,
	for example, to execute program.
